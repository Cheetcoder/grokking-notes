1.  Maximum Subarray: This problem involves finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within an array. A common approach to solve this problem is to use the "Kadane's algorithm".
    
2.  Minimum Size Subarray Sum: This problem requires finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that adds up to a given target value. A possible solution is to use two pointers to keep track of the start and end of the subarray.
    
3.  Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters: This problem involves finding the longest substring in a string that contains at most K distinct characters. A sliding window approach can be used to keep track of the distinct characters and the length of the substring.
    
4.  Fruit Into Baskets: This problem requires finding the length of the longest subarray that contains at most two distinct elements. A sliding window approach can be used to keep track of the distinct elements and the length of the subarray.
    
5.  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: This problem involves finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. A sliding window approach can be used along with a hashmap to keep track of the characters and the length of the substring.
    
6.  Longest Repeating Character Replacement: This problem requires finding the length of the longest substring in which a single character can be replaced at most K times. A sliding window approach can be used along with a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each character in the substring.
    
7.  Max Consecutive Ones III: This problem involves finding the length of the longest subarray that contains at most K zeros. A sliding window approach can be used to keep track of the number of zeros in the subarray.
    
8.  Permutation in String: This problem involves checking if one string is a permutation of another. A sliding window approach can be used along with two hashmaps to keep track of the frequency of each character in the two strings.
    
9.  Find All Anagrams in a String: This problem involves finding all the starting indices of anagrams of a given pattern in a string. A sliding window approach can be used along with a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each character in the pattern and the window.
    
10.  Minimum Window Substring: This problem involves finding the minimum length substring that contains all the characters in a target string. A sliding window approach can be used along with two hashmaps to keep track of the frequency of each character in the target string and the window.
    
11.  Substring with Concatenation of All Words: This problem involves finding all the starting indices of a concatenation of all words in a target string. A sliding window approach can be used along with a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each word in the words array and the window.
