1.  Two Sum The goal of this problem is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target number. Hint: You can use two pointers, starting from the beginning and end of the array and moving them towards each other based on the current sum being less than or greater than the target.
    
2.  Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array The goal of this problem is to remove all the duplicates in a sorted array and return the new length of the array. Hint: You can use two pointers, where one pointer iterates through the array while the other keeps track of the unique elements.
    
3.  Squares of a Sorted Array The goal of this problem is to find the squares of the elements in a sorted array. Hint: You can use two pointers, starting from the beginning and end of the array, and moving them towards each other based on the current value of the square being negative or positive.
    
4.  3Sum The goal of this problem is to find all the unique triplets in an array that add up to 0. Hint: You can use two pointers, where one pointer starts from the beginning of the array and the other two pointers start from the end of the array and move towards each other based on the current sum being less than or greater than 0.
    
5.  3Sum Closest The goal of this problem is to find the triplet in an array that is closest to a target number. Hint: You can sort the array and then use two pointers, starting from the beginning and end of the array, and moving them towards each other based on the current sum being less or greater than the target.
    
6.  3Sum Smaller The goal of this problem is to find the number of triplets in an array that add up to a target number. Hint: You can sort the array and then use two pointers, starting from the end of the array, and moving the pointers towards each other based on the current sum being less or greater than the target.
    
7.  Subarray Product Less Than K The goal of this problem is to find the number of subarrays in an array that have a product less than a target number. Hint: You can use two pointers, where one pointer keeps track of the start of the subarray while the other pointer moves forward to expand the subarray until its product becomes greater than the target.
    
8.  Sort Colors The goal of this problem is to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s. Hint: You can use two pointers, where one pointer keeps track of the position of 0s and the other pointer keeps track of the position of 2s, and then you can iterate through the array and place 1s in the remaining positions.
    
9.  4Sum The goal of this problem is to find all the unique quadruplets in an array that add up to a target number. Hint: You can use two nested loops to find all the possible pairs, and then use two pointers to find the elements that add up to the target.
    
10.  Backspace String Compare The goal of this problem is to compare two strings, where "#" represents a backspace. Hint: You can use two pointers, starting from the end of the strings, and move them towards the beginning while ignoring the backspaces.
    
11.  Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray The goal of this problem is to find the length of the shortest continuous subarray that needs to be sorted to make the entire array sorted. Hint: You can use two pointers.
